The Twitter API currently consists of two discrete APIs. Most application developers mix and match the APIs to produce their application. 
The separation of the REST and Search APIs is less than ideal and it is entirely due to history 
It is in our pipeline to ameliorate Twitter's API by combining the Search and REST pieces as development cycles allow. 
The API Overview portion of the Getting Started series explains the history.
